This repository is a collection of all the bigger projects 
and some of the code challenges i have made on the Front-End Engineer course on Codecademy.

The big projects (with multiple files) are in their own separate folders 
with the same name as the assignments on Codecademy.

If a project at the end of a lesson or chapter was just a single file, 
then these are added to the folder with the name of the entire chapter and
the file itself will have the name of the assignment.

Thanks for reading!
